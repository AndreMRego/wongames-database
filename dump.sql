The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

Lord British has produced a game to challenge not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character.<br><br>\nThe evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain.

Here’s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it’s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/CavernTravelling.gif"><h4>Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>New levels</b>: You’ve got a new level that’s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who’s finished the game at least once.

Nothing is easy in paradise.\n<br><b><h4>Hero Time, wall-running, dashing and grappling hooks, oh my</h4></b><i>Turbo Overkill</i> takes over-the-top to never-before-reached heights. Activate Hero Time(™), a new form of slow motion with a twist. Build incredible speed by wall-running and dashing. Slide on your chainsaw leg, eviscerating foes and opening up bosses for critical damage, and go car-surfing on the hoods of flying cars. Blast away with the Twin Magnums, which lock-on and instagib several foes, the Boomer Shotgun and its attached grenade launcher, or the Telefragger sniper rifle, which teleports Johnny inside an enemy before they explode from within. The FPS genre is about to get wild and fun again.\n<br><br>\nRace through two dozen stages packed with secrets, bonus arena stages, and white-knuckle combat puzzles. Find game-changing collectibles to unlock punishing modifiers like triple-monster-speed and insta-kill.

Relentless enemies, extremely deadly and fun weapons, speed and precision above all else—if you love <i>Quake III Arena</i>, modern and classic <i>DOOM</i>, or Apogee’s legendary first-person shooters, you’ll feel right at home in Paradise.”\n<br><br>\n“As the guy who helped launch the shooter genre with <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>, <i>Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem 3D, Max Payne</i>, and <i>Prey</i>, I haven’t been this excited about an FPS since the golden era of Apogee/3D Realms,” wrote Scott Miller, founder. “<i>Turbo Overkill</i> is a sandbox of fun and original gameplay ideas that come together like a night of melty hot pizza and your favorite cold, frothy brew. Playing this game made me a Turbo Lover all over again.”\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright (c) 2020 Trigger Happy Interactive.

Free roam across the vibrant prison island of Peh, and choose whether to help or exploit its many citizens.<br><br>\n\nIf there’s one place that Master Thief Teriel avoids at all costs, it’s the prison island of Peh. But when a daring heist takes an unexpected turn, Teriel finds himself shackled on an airship bound for the infamous island. To make matters worse, the daemon inside his head makes it very clear that the thief will never leave unless he does exactly what he’s told.<br><br><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/seven_the_days_long_gone"><b>Seven: The Days Long Gone</b></a> you play as Teriel. You must use all of your cunning and clandestine skills to escape a web of deceit and betrayal, and ultimately survive Peh.\n\n<br><br><b></b><h4><b>EXPLORE A VIBRANT OPEN WORLD FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE</b></h4> From the moment you set foot on Peh, the island is open to you. Sneak, run, climb, and fight your way across a colourful array of environments. You are free to explore wherever you please; only security checkpoints, monster-infested areas, and dangerous factions stand in your way!\n<b></b><h4><b>CHOOSE YOUR PLAYSTYLE</b></h4>  As a master thief, Teriel is well versed in the art of stealth. Get the jump on enemies from behind and above, fool everyone with cunning disguises, or just use the environment to keep out of sight entirely. If things go wrong, however, or you’re feeling impatient, there’s nothing to stop you from letting loose with an array of devastating weapons, and unleashing deadly magical skills upon your foes.\n<b></b><h4><b>ENCOUNTER A MYRIAD OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS</b></h4>  Encounter an array of people, from despondent slaves and prisoners through to rich socialites. Just be sure to keep an eye out for the two major factions on Peh: the Biomancers and the Technomagi. In such a desperate place, there are many who will take any help they can get.

You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\n<br><br>\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the <i>Bad North</i>.\n<br><br><h2><b>Key Features:</b></h2><br><b>REAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE: </b> Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose.

The borders protected by the fierce King’s Knights are no longer secure. The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably. \n<br><br>\nChaos seizes the World. Only the memory of the oldest recalls the exploits of a hero and a few warriors, who in other times fought against the forces of Chaos. Ianna, the mother of all living beings, gave the hero a powerful sword to enter the abyss and defeat evil. But that happened a long time ago. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever.<h4>FOUR PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</h4>Pick your Champion of Ianna — Tukaram, the Barbarian; Naglfar, the Dwarf; Sargon, the Knight; or Zoe, the Amazon — each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and fighting skills, as you hack ‘n slash your way through a blood-drenched quest to save the world from the forces of Chaos.<h4>BLOODY &amp; GORY COMBAT</h4> Learn devastating combo attacks and use them to slice your opponents into pieces. Hack off your foes’ limbs, then use them as weapons!<h4>A DETAILED &amp; DARK FANTASY WORLD</h4> Battle orcs, trolls, golems, demons, skeletons, and scores of malevolent enemy creatures as you explore treacherous tombs, frozen fortresses, demon spires, deserts, temples, and palaces.<h4>INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS</h4> Destroy in-game objects with fire or your fists as you solve puzzles and disarm traps that combine physics, hydraulic systems, and lethal traps!<h4>RE-RELEASE OF A TRUE GENRE-DEFINING GAME</h4> We are happy to bring Blade of Darkness back to life, an enduring classic that, at the time of its release, inspired many games in the action-adventure genre through its approach to combat. With this edition we've re-engineered the game to work on modern PC hardware, added widescreen support up to 4K resolution, introduced new display settings, and improved its overall stability. At the same time, the gameplay, content, and the story are untouched — featuring all the game’s quirks and charm.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © SNEG Ltd.

The famed Slovakian highlander and robber Janosik just finished a quest to rescue his comrades and is now on the path to defeat even more enemies – both mythical and historical. This time around, it’s not the band of brothers that’s missing, but rather Janosik himself. Caught with an ingenious ruse, our hero must rescue himself, his beloved and make new friends on the way.\n<br><h4>STORY</h4>\nAccompany Highlander Janosik, Bogdan the Werewolf and a cloak-wrapped Vampire as they explore the dark and trap-filled castle von Zur, house to the nefarious kidnapper Baron. Trek through dense mountain forests that are home to feral dogs, headless skeletons and more, all bent on making your life harder. Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/1.gif"><br><h4>A bigger adventure</h4>\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/2.gif"><br><h4>These Walls Were Meant to Be Broken</h4>\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/3.gif"><br><h4>Die, Die and Repea... Die Again</h4>\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br><h4>Is This A Joke to You?</h4>\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br><h4>Scenes That Cut</h4>\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br><h4>Get Collecting</h4>\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.\n\n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	99.99	1970-01-01	BR0	71	2022-06-21 13:53:36.796+00	\N	\N	2022-06-21 13:53:56.364+00	2022-06-21 13:53:59.359+00

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	99.99	1970-01-01	BR0	71	2022-06-21 13:53:53.452+00	\N	\N	2022-06-21 13:54:00.526+00	2022-06-21 13:54:00.894+00

While heavily inspired by classic games such as Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden, Brave Earth: Prologue strikes its own balance between methodical, high risk gameplay and aggressive, fast-paced action.

Mostly because it actually has been. The side project that was supposed to take a few months instead sprawled into a retail game that has taken several years to complete.\n<br><br>\nBrave Earth wears its influences a bit... shamelessly on its sleeve. The game was originally conceived to be a freeware "study" game for me -- learning through emulation. But the product I'm releasing is more than just emulation. I've tried my best to both understand and then build upon one of my favorite eras in platformers to almost arrive at a uniquely different alternative reality. A more modern sensibility without playing like a modern take on a retro game.\n<br><br>\nAs George Lucas's Star Wars built upon and paid tribute Flash Gordon while establishing its own voice, I'm hoping Brave Earth can do the same.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/brave_earth_prologue/pub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\nThis is Dan Stern from Dangen Entertainment. I’m both pleased and proud to present Brave Earth: Prologue. \n<br><br>\nI’ve said in other places how happy I am for pixel art to have made a come back with the independent development scene. The pixel art in BEP is excellent, but what I have found to stand out and amaze me in this game is the meticulous care that Kayin put into designing the encounters. It doesn’t come as any surprise to me considering his previous work, but in no time at all I got the feeling that he was in my own head in a sense. \n<br><br>\nKayin’s complete understanding of player psychology is as enviable as it is rare in game development. I Wanna Be the Guy was a game that was completely designed around it. Traps spring up and invisible blocks bar your path, leading to your frequent death. It was almost as much a commentary on game design in a meta sense as it was a clever arrangement of platforming puzzles. \n<br><br>\nIn Brave Earth: Prologue, by contrast, traps and obstacles are laid bare before you. This is not a game meant to trick you cleverly, but rather to masterfully utilize a comprehensive understanding of what makes for a satisfying challenge.\n<br><br>\nIt’s remarkable that the game also leads the player along a logical path through the game’s world, with three totally different playable characters, no less. While level-based rather than open world, BEP still gave me a powerful sense of progress, journey and adventure. To find that depth of setting in a game with so much attention paid to the gameplay balance is impressive to say the least.\n<br><br>\nI couldn’t be more proud to work with a talented developer like Kayin. This game is a masterpiece of 8-bit era game design and it vastly raises the bar in my eyes as a gamer. I can’t wait for you all to experience it.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT is a trademark of Dangen Entertainment.\nCopyright © 2017 Dangen Entertainment.

They founded farms, raised cattle, dug for gold, built settlements and towns. \n<br><br>\nA small find of gold is often enough to draw hundreds of daring adventurers while quickly a small settlement becomes a flourishing town with saloons, merchants, gambling, adventurers, and gunslingers... \n<br><br>\nEnter this breathtakingly exciting time and conquer the Wild West. Emerge from being a lonesome cowboy over founding a settlement to becoming the mayor of a gold-digger town: there are hardly any limits to your personal endeavors. \n<br><br>\nYou start out as a lonesome cowboy who comes across an abandoned ranch and decides to stay. You start repairing and expanding. You gather food, hunt for animals and sell their meat and leather to settler trecks. Once you have established a decent ranch, other settlers may decide to stay and ask for permission to settle down. You start building a town with all its classic locations such as saloon, Sheriff office, stores and even hotels.

I discovered this game by chance as a kid - I was wondering what to play next (and I’ve just begun my lifelong adventure with PC gaming) and this game was added to my newly bought graphics card. I installed it and after the first minutes in Seyda Neen I knew that it was it - unique setting, weird monsters and the freedom to just walk around Vvardenfell, visit different cities, read (a lot of) books and do quests for different factions. \n\nI go back to this game quite often (apreciating the music in the game even more) and go on an adventure with a newly created character. Morrowind is definitely a must play for everyone who loves cRPGs or looks for an unique open world setting and I hope that you will like it as much as I do. Just watch out for the cliff racers as they really want to follow you wherever you go ;) </i><br><br><b>Click <a href="https://www.gog.com/partner/throwback_thursday">here</a> to discover the ever-expanding Throwback Thursday collection of games.</b><br><img alt="" src="https://items.gog.com/news/tt_ribbon_bottom.png"><hr><br>	4.49	2002-04-28	BR0	12	2022-06-21 13:56:37.52+00	\N	\N	2022-06-21 13:56:48.022+00	2022-06-21 13:56:48.394+00

Take command of the Mobile Infantry and d	<b>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</b> is a thrilling real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers movies universe. Take command of the Mobile Infantry and do your part in the war against the Arachnid threat. Build, develop and control your armies to strike an effective balance between tactical superiority and strength in numbers. Ensure that human civilization, not insect, dominates the galaxy now and always!<h4>Story Campaign</h4>The population of the harsh desert planet Kwalasha needs our help. Their daily lives of hard work in the mining industries has been disturbed by a new danger that they cannot face alone: the Arachnid. The Mobile Infantry will swiftly move in, take back control over the planet and smash everything that has more than two legs. Take part in this exciting military campaign, meet unique characters, see amazing locations and experience the heroic war against the Bug.<h4>Tactics &amp; Numbers</h4>While the Arachnids can rely on virtually limitless numbers, the Mobile Infantry must develop effective tactics to overcome this imbalance. Deploy your units at strategic locations to cover vital choke points and gain superior firepower through tactical use of elevation levels. Be wary, however, that battle mechanics such as True Line of Sight and True Line of Fire also allow Bugs to lay ambushes around every corner, as they are well known for their use of surprise attacks and deception.<h4>Units &amp; Abilities</h4>An expansive range of unique units are at your disposal, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and unlockable elite abilities. Squads of Rifle Troopers, for example, form the mainstay of your forces and can utilize “shotgun suppression” or “boom bundles” when they reach the elite experience level. Rocket Troopers on the other hand are specialists that deliver various types of deadly ordnance, ranging from armor-piercing and high-explosive warheads to incendiary and canister payloads.\n<br><br>\nAs a campaign progresses, new technology buildings can be deployed to unlock the true potential of the Federation’s arsenal with E-Pulse rifles, TAC Fighter airstrikes, heavily armed Marauder bipedal vehicles, and many more developments optimized for spraying Bug ichor across the battlefield.<h4>Key features </h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.\n<br></li><li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.\n<br></li><li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.\n<br></li><li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.\n<br></li><li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs.
